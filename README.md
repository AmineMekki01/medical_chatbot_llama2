# medical_chatbot_llama2
I will be using Llama 2 to build a medical chatbot.


Building the medical chatbot requires an llm model 
i am going to use llama2 but i can't just get it and use it. I need a quantized model. I will take it from the block on HF.
- once downloaded we load it using Ctransformers (cpp) a python binding for transformers using cpp. 
- I will need also sentence transformers.
- Also vector database, i will use faiss cpu because i already have knowledge and experience using it.
